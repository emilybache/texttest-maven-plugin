Name: TextTest Maven Plugin
Description: (no description available)
Group Id: org.texttest
Artifact Id: texttest-maven-plugin
Version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Goal Prefix: texttest

This plugin has 1 goal:

texttest:install-texttests
  Description: This maven plugin will set up your texttests so they can be
    run by Maven.
  Implementation: org.texttest.InstallTextTestsMojo
  Language: java

  Available parameters:

    addClasspathToTextTestEnvironment (Default: true)
      User property: add_classpath
      Whether to add the classpath to texttest's environment file for this
      application. If you're testing an application on the JVM this is usually
      needed.

    appName (Default: ${project.artifactId})
      User property: app_name
      The short name of the texttest app - ie the file extension of the
      texttest config file. Defaults to the artifactId of your project.

    installGlobally (Default: false)
      User property: install_globally
      Whether to install the texttests globally by putting a softlink to them
      under the 'texttest_root' folder. If you set this to true then you must
      also specify 'texttest_root' Defaults to false

    texttestRoot
      User property: texttest_root
      The path to TEXTTEST_ROOT - ie where the texttest runner will find your
      test cases. If the parameter 'install_globally' is set to true, then this
      must be set, and is expected to be a global location on your machine
      where you may have many test suites installed. If you don't set this
      value, we use the environment variable $TEXTTEST_ROOT If that is not set,
      we will use the environment variable $TEXTTEST_HOME as a fallback option.
      If neither are set, we use ${basedir}/src/it/texttest
